# 🧠 Machine Learning with Python – by Mayank Raj Srivastava

Welcome to my **Machine Learning** journey! This repository contains all the hands-on work, study notes, and mini-projects I am building to learn and master machine learning from scratch, using Python and popular libraries like **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn**, and more.

> ✨ I am learning through structured projects, building real notebooks in Google Colab, and sharing everything here for others to learn too.
